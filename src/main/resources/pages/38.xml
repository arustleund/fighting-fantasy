				You fling open the door and your nose is assaulted by the filthy smell of half-tanned leathers that are soaking
				in reeking fluids. The robed man stands with a bag of coins in one hand and a dagger in the other, while a
				nervous raven-haired young artisan in a leather apron is holding out his hands for the money. At once, the 
				hard-faced sword-wielder spins around to fight you.

				Each Attack Round, the leatherworker will throw a pot full of acid at you while you are fighting the robed man.
				One die will be rolled; if it is a 5 or 6, the acid splashes on you and you must lose 3 Stamina points.
				If a 1 is rolled, the acid hits your opponent (and <i>he</i> loses 3 Stamina points)! If any other number
				is rolled, the acid misses you both.

			The leatherworker flees before you can catch him, but he leaves the bag with 6 Gold Pieces in it. 1 is added
			to your Nemesis score.
