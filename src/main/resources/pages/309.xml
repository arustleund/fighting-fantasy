				The Black Dragon grins in a way you do not find entirely wholesome; he has a hungry look about him. 'The Ancient lies to the 
				north of here. But we do not know where; the Loremaster knows how to find the Ancient's caves. We know that, if you find
				sword, shield, and armour, you will find him; we also know that he has a wandering servant of strange aspect who travels
				in the Icefinger Mountains. By great good fortune you might encounter him &#8212; though, from what little we know, he will
				not be what you expect!'

				The Dragons give you further information. The Stalkers which serve the Ancient are reptiles, mutated Dragon hatchlings stolen
				and distorted by magic. The Dragons look angry when they speak of these creatures, and they warn you that Stalkers grow more
				numerous as time passes! There are also robed men, acolytes and assassins, who serve the Ancient, and they hold sway over the town
				of Carnex &#8212; beware that place! All this takes time to learn, so 1 is added to your Time Track. The Conclave has told you
				the essence of your task now: to find sword, shield and armour, and the Loremaster too. It is time to meet your destiny!
