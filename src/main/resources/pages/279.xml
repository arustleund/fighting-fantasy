			Lord Azzur's militia have no real interest in thieves, but you've certainly caused a rumpus so they
			escort you to the Watch-house. They detain you for hours, interrogate you over and over again, then
			extract 3 Gold Pieces from you for wasting their time! 1 is added to your Time Track; if you had no
			money for your bail, they detain you overnight and make you slop out the cells in the morning (so
			an extra 1 is added to your Time Track). When they release you, you can <a href="http://link:354">
			make for Lobster Wharf</a> or <a href="http://link:212">Weaver Gate</a>.
