			Skirting round the path taken by the pilgrims, you head eastwards and enter the woodlands. It is
			very dark below the light-excluding evergreens and the ground is bare, save for a thin carpeting of 
			pine needles and cones. A haze of blue wood-smoke leads you to a wooden cabin. A woodcutter, you 
			expect, but you couldn't be more wrong. As you creep up to the back door, past the piles of chopped
			logs, someone taps you on the back and you whirl around, wondering how on Titan anyone could have
			surprised you like that. Standing behind you is a Dwarf; he is wearing a chainmail vest and is tapping
			tobacco into his briarwood pipe, a two-handed battleaxe hanging from one wrist. 'Nosy, aren't you?'
			he says nonchalantly. 'If you want rest and shelter, my adventurous friend, I'll want something in
			return.' 
			</p>
			<p>
			The Dwarf isn't after money, having little use for it. You can stay and talk with him if you will
			give him a <a href="http://domulti:0">Potion</a>, a <a href="http://domulti:1">flask of liqueur</a>, 
			or a <a href="http://domulti:2">small keg of beer</a>; If you don't have any of these, or won't part
			with them, you'll have to <a href="http://link:275">sleep outside tonight</a>.
