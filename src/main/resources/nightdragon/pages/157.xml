			'Quiet enough,' the Dwarf says as he takes another gulp of strong ale. 'There's a village, Sharndale,
			north of the woods and not much else before yer get to Rentarn. But I have seen a Frost Giant or two
			to the north-east, although I haven't heard of them attacking hunters or trappers hereabouts. You
			don't want to be fighting any of them - they're as tough as my boots. If you've got some firewater
			with you, though, they'll drink themselves stupid on it. Drunkards, they are.' If you want to ask the
			Dwarf about something else, you can <a href="http://link:90">ask about the Dragon Reaches</a> or 
			<a href="http://link:337">the men in grey</a>; or you can just <a href="http://link:275">turn in for the
			night and get some sleep</a>.
