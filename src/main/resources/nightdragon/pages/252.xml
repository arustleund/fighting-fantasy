			You run to catch up with the men, who seem happy enough to share your company along the road.
			They are pilgrims, they say, heading for a northern temple to gain learning. They are quiet, 
			hard-faced men and they soon return to their dirge-like chanting. However, they share a little
			food with you at the end of the day's walk, and you prepare to sleep out under the stars in this
			strange company. <a href="http://testluck:0"><i>Test your Luck</i></a>.
