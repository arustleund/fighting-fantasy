			The Dwarf spits into the wood fire which warms the cabin. 'Beware of them,' he hisses. 'The grey
			'uns, they're just the small fry, but the ones in black robes, they're dangerous. Bad men. Seen one
			or two in the woods, heading northwards. I heard tell they're making for the Dragon Reaches. Come from
			some place north-west of there. Don't you mix with them.' Now, if you want to ask the Dwarf about
			something you haven't enquired about already, you can <a href="http://link:90">ask about the Dragon
			Reaches</a> or <a href="http://link:157">the area around in general</a> or you can just 
			<a href="http://link:275">turn in for the night and get some sleep</a>.
