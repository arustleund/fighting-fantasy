			The sign of the Rudderless Galley swings, creaking, to and fro in the north wind. Approaching the
			dockside tavern past the alleys and byways, you thought you saw a grey-robed man duck into the
			shadows just before you reached the tavern door, or was it just a trick of the light? You push
			past the seamen and merchants inside the tavern, walk across the sawdust floor to the stairway and 
			climb as far as the landing. You make your way to the third door along, as instructed, and take the
			silver key from your pocket. <a href="http://domulti:0"><i>Test your Skill</i></a>.
