			You have a Stamina of 20 or more, the first mate looks you over and decides you're a strong
			fellow, so you can get passage for a mere 4 Gold Pieces, if you're prepared to work aboard ship,
			slaving at rope-tarring and deck-scrubbing. You'll get a bunk to sleep in, but you'll have to 
			provide your own food! If you want to <a href="http://domulti:0">accept this offer</a> and can pay, 
			the number of meals which you are told to consume during the journey aboard ship will be doubled.
			Otherwise you must <a href="http://link:212">travel by land</a>.

			Your Stamina is below 20, so you have to <a href="http://domulti:1">play the full fare of 10 Gold
			Pieces</a>; otherwise you must <a href="http://link:212">travel by land</a>.
