			The body is that of a dark-haired young man; he is blue with cold and is wearing a simple black robe
			with a knotted black cord tied round the waist. There is a distinctive tattoo on his left hand which
			shows a coiled black serpent with red glowing eyes. If you have an ice pick and wish to chip the body
			away from the ice, click <a href="http://domulti:0">here</a>. If you do not have an ice pick, or you 
			don't wish to do this, click <a href="http://link:112">here</a>.
