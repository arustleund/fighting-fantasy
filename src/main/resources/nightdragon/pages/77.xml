			Walking through the throng of lowlife in Harbour Street, not far from the infamous Black Lobster inn
			itself, you fall prey to one of the notorious pickpockets of Blacksand. You feel your bag of coins
			grabbed from your belt and spin around just in time to see a scrawny, rat-faced young man darting away
			down a side-alley. If you want to pursue the thief, click <a href="http://link:11">here</a>. If you
			don't wish to do so, you can <a href="http://link:354">head for Lobster Wharf</a> or 
			<a href="http://link:212">Weaver Gate</a>, but now you will have no Gold Pieces left. Alternatively,
			you could <a href="http://link:279">cry 'Thief! Stop him!'</a> and hope that one of Lord Azzur's 
			militiamen will help you out.
