				At last, down at the docks, you have a stroke of good luck. One of the throng of sailors appears to know something.
				'Ah, the <i>Endimion</i>. Due in from the Eelsea on the lunchtime tide. Me bruvver's second mate on that ship,'
				he says, his chest swelling with family pride. Sure enough, come noontime, the ship arrives at the dock.
				You ask the captain if he has any passengers on board; even as you speak, however, you see out of the corner of your
				eye a black-cloaked figure skulking below decks. Fearing he may be up to no good, you yell at him, and he spins
				around to face you - a Dark Elf! He holds up his hands to hush you and, as he does, his head jerks backwards and you
				see a long, heavy dart suddenly protruding from his neck. On the dockside, you spot a black-robed man darting away
				into a warehouse. If you want to pursue this assassin, click <a href="http://link:62">here</a>. If you want to try to 
				help the Dark Elf, click <a href="http://link:155">here</a>.
