				Ismater is a large village nestling in the foothills of the forbidding nothern and eastern mountains; herders, fur-trappers,
				nomadic hillsmen, merchants and even a handful of barbarian warriors make it a lively place. You need to sleep and rest
				(2 is added to your Time Track) and you must then eat a meal. Next day, you may conduct your business here. You could seek
				work if you're very low on supplies, you could buy equipment, explore the village fully, or hang around in the taverns and inns
				of the town to see if you overhear anything of interest. Will you:
