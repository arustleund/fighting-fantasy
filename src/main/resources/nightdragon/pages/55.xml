			You start from sleep just after midnight when one of the cloaked men stumbles as he heads towards you.
			You see the knife in his hand gleaming in the pale moonlight, and you grab you sword to defend yourself.
			Two of the men are awake and ready to fight with their odd, curved blades. You must fight them together.
			After four Attack Rounds, the third man will have woken and be ready to join the fray as well!

			You search the bodies. You can take 5 Gold Pieces and enough Provisions for four meals from them,
			but you also find a strange mark tattooed on the forearm of each man. The symbol shows a twenty-stranded
			spider's-web pattern with a black reptilian skull at its centre.
			1 is added to your Nemesis score, then you <a href="http://link:275">resume your disturbed slumber</a>.
