			<p>
			The body is that of a man who has been robbed, badly beaten and left for dead. He tries to speak but
			you hush him to be silent. He points east, along a track, and gestures for you to help him. You can
			<a href="http://link:304">leave him here and continue along the road</a> or you can 
			<a href="http://link:176">carry him along the track, looking for help</a>, even though it could cost
			you a lot of time.
