			Lobster Wharf boasts the scurviest seamen in all Allansia. Half of them look as though their only 
			reason for not brawling on the dockside is because they're too drunk to raise their fists! After your 
			queries have extracted some foul oaths and curses from these evil brutes, you find out that the 
			<i>Blackheart</i> is sailing for Rentarn within the hour. The ship's first mate tells you that 
			passage there will cost you 10 Gold Pieces. If you're prepared to pay that, and you've got the money, 
			<a href="http://domulti:0">click here</a>. If you can't pay that much (or you're too mean), you can
			<a href="http://link:171">try to haggle</a> or you can <a href="http://link:212">make for Weaver Gate 
			and take the northern coast road</a>.
