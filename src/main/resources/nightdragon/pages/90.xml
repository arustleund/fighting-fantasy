			You ask the Dwarf what he knows about the Dragon Reaches, and he looks at you with a glint in his
			eye. 'Dangerous lands. The last civilized town there is Ismater, north-east of Rentarn. I do have
			some interest in an old story about the Dragon Reaches, I must admit. There are legends of a lost
			dwarf clan below Slate Peak, a great grey mountain far to the north-west. Too far for me to go, and
			it's probably only another tall tale. But, many years ago, I picked up a coin said to be from them.'
			He puffs at his pipe as he reaches into a pocket and pulls out a very old, well-rubbed brass coin.
			'Give it yer for a couple of gold. Might be some use to yer, if you're heading that way.'

			If you want to buy the dwarven coin, you must <a href="http://buyItem:19">give the Dwarf 2 Gold
			Pieces for it</a>. You can now <a href="http://link:275">turn in for the night</a>, or
			<a href="http://link:337">ask about the grey-cloaked men</a> or <a href="http://link:157">the
			area generally</a>, if you haven't already raised the subject.
