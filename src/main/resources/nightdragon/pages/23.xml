			2 is added to your Time Track, and you must now eat a meal. It is mid-afternoon when you see a large, winged creature in the sky,
			certainly no bird; your hope, that it may be a Dragon, is rewarded. But what a surprise you get &#8212; this is a green Dragon, normally
			a dweller in forests or jungles, not in the cold wastes of the northern lands! The beast lands close by and simply nods his massive
			head towards you. You clamber on to his back and hold on for dear life as he rises into the sky and flaps imperiously to a distant peak,
			where he lands and deposits you beside a huge cave mouth. Stepping off your enormous mount, you see that the tunnel opens into a vast
			crater in the mountain, probably half a kilometre wide. Within the crater, awaiting your descent down a seemingly endless set of 
			chiselled stone steps, is a circle of six huge adult Dragons &#8212; black, white, red, green, gold and silver. You are one of a mere 
			handful of people alive on Titan ever to have been invited to such a conclave! Click <a href="http://link:49">here</a> to continue.
