				Stormdrake Pass, which grows narrower as the peaks of the Dragon Reaches margin begin to ascend round it,
				is not a well-travelled path. The only signs of life you see as you trudge along the rocky track are birds
				wheeling overhead and an occasional lethargic rock lizard skittering away from your footsteps. A few thick-leaved
				succulents hug the ground tightly, the only plant life you can see. This is barren terrain indeed, but you feel
				fortunate at having avoided any monsters during your first day's travel, and you sleep safely in a small cave.
				2 is added to your Time Track, and you must now eat a meal. The following day you soon come to a fork in the trail.
				North-north-west, the trail is hardly perceptible any longer; pointing to the north-eastern fork is a badly weathered
				wooden sign, where you can just make out what is left of the original inscription; it says simply:
				'TO IS&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;ER'. You cannot decipher the letters in the middle. If you want to head north-eastwards, click
				<a href="http://link:322">here</a>. If you want to go to the north-north-west, click <a href="http://link:23">here</a>.
