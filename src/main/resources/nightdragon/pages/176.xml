			You have to carry the man for half a dozen kilometres before a trapper with a sled overtakes you. The
			burly trapper recognizes the victim and says he comes from the village of Sharndale, seven kilometres 
			further along. The two of you unload furs and goods from the sled, put the injured man on it, and you
			help by carrying the bulky furs along the road to Sharndale. You deliver the man to his family, who make
			him as comfortable as they can. The weather is closing in, with chill, sleeting rain drifting down from
			iron-grey clouds, and you'll not get to Rentarn before dark now. You are invited to stay with the family;
			they will give you some furs by way of thanks, as well as hot food and a comfortable bed for the night.
