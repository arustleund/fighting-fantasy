				You push open the creaking green door of the shop with some trepidation. There's a confusion of rubbish inside: stuffed animal
				heads and rugs hang from the walls, sacks of grubby grain are stacked haphazardly against one another, and shelves are packed with
				glass bottles containing rather disgusting things in coloured fluids. It looks, and smells, as if no one has cleaned the place for
				a decade or two. A shuffling sound comes from behind the counter, and a wizened, little, middle-aged man with lank, greasy hair and
				a pair of pince-nez glasses perched on top of his huge beaky nose peers anxiously up at you from his perch on a five-legged footstool.
				'Erm, Nevill's the name. Can I possibly be of some assistance?' You mutter something about his shop sign, still trying to take in
				the contents of this weird shop. 'Ah, erm, yes, well, it's <i>Nevill</i>, that's my name. Oh yes. Says "evil", does it? Letters 
				flake off, you know, must get it repainted sometime.' The little man's demeanour, suddenly changes to one of altertness. 'I've got
				no time to spare, young fellow,' he says testily. 'Got any gold, eh? Got some things might interest an adventurer like yourself!'

				he has is useless. However, there are some exceptions. Click <a href="http://link:106">here</a> to continue.
