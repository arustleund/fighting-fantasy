			The thief runs into a cul-de-sac and is forced to turn and face you, drawing a sword and uttering
			threats. You wouldn't worry if it was just him you had to face, but his accomplice is a scar-faced
			cut-throat built like a brick outhouse and he's holding his sword in a way that suggests he really
			knows how to use it. If you decide to fight this pair, click <a href="http://link:101">here</a>.
			If you want to back off, you can <a href="http://link:354">head for Lobster Wharf</a> or
			<a href="http://link:212">Weaver Gate</a> but now you will have no Gold Pieces left!
