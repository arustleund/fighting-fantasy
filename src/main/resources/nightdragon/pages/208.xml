			The other monster has killed two of the sailors, but the huge furred Sea Serpents' corpses are now
			being dragged aboard and skinned. The fur is largely ruined from sword and dagger thrusts, but the
			meat can be sold, even though it's as tough as old boots. You leave the sailors to their messy work
			and get some sleep. 2 is added to your Time Track.

			In the morning, you must eat another meal. It's foggy today, with a creeping sea mist making 
			navigation difficult, and one or two ice-floes go drifting by as you peer into the gloom. One
			particular floe, some distance away, catches your eye as the mist thins momentarily; you think you
			can see a dark shape on the ice, though you can't make out any details. If you want to ignore it,
			click <a href="http://link:112">here</a>. If you want to ask the captain to let you go over in a 
			rowing-boat and investigate the object, click <a href="http://link:394">here</a>.
