				Ruminating over where to go next, you are only a short distance from the cave when the Green Dragon which brought you here comes
				up behind you and hails you, so you turn to hear what he has to say. 'Listen, brave one. I know the task which awaits you. I
				can tell you more about what you need to know, and I can even fly you to a place to which you should be taken. I know where the
				sword, shield and armour lie &#8212; although, by giving you such direct help, I may violate the Oath of Kilanirax. And I will
				suffer for that.' The Dragon shivers, and your eyes dilate at the thought of what could scare a twenty-metre Dragon!
