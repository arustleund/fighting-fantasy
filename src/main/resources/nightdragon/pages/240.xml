				The Dragon speaks to you as you wheel through the skies. 'The Ancient has one great weakness. Light will blind and distract him,
				if you can find magical light to fling into his face. The greatest of all magical treasures the Loremaster can guide you to is
				the Magic Mirror within the Dreamtime. Make sure you find this; your quest will be far harder without it. If the Mirror calls for
				sacrifice on your part, do not deny it.'

				Hours pass and the Dragon finally lands at your chosen destination. But just as he does so, he gives a terrible cough and chokes
				on his own blood as you stagger away, horrified at his convulsions. The Dragon has broken the Oath by giving you aid, and as a result
				he is dying. This event will be sensed far away ... 1 is added to your Nemesis score. Now, which destination did you choose? If
				you chose to be taken to the sword, click <a href="http://link:21">here</a>. If you chose to be taken to the armour, click
				<a href="http://link:5">here</a>. If you chose to be taken to the shield, the Dragon has taken you most, but not all, of the great
				distance to it; click <a href="http://link:334">here</a>.
