			You open the door and admit the landlord of the tavern, together with two militiamen. You tell them
			the truth about what happened here, and they seem ready to believe you. 'Bad sorts, these,' says one
			of the militia as he turns over the body of one of the grey-robed men with his foot. 'We'll have to
			take you down to the jailhouse overnight, of course, but sleeping there is not so bad and frankly
			you may be safer.' Indeed, a night spent in jail means you are warm and well fed - and you even win
			3 Gold Pieces from your jailers, playing dice! Gain 1 Luck point. Click <a href="http://link:387">
