			Three grey-robed men are standing in the room and a body lies slumped on the bed; the window to the
			docks beyond is open. The men have coshes and knives, and they've been expecting you. They are all
			dark-haired and have an evil glint in their eyes; as one of them slams the door shut behind you, you
			know you're going to be lucky to survive this! You can fight them one at a time in this enclosed space 
			as you back into a corner of the room.

		You turn over the body on the bed; it is that of a Dark Elf, presumably the person you were expecting to
		meet. His throat has been crushed, and he's beyond help. Frantically searching his body, you find 3 Gold
		Pieces and a silver plaque clutched in one hand with a single word hastily carved into it: 'Endimion'.
