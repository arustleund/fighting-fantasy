			Chipping the body out of the ice, you manage to turn it over, and you dig out of the ice a pouch
			containing 4 Gold Pieces and some frozen Provisions in a bag (2 is added to your Provisions). A
			single sheet of vellum has writing on it; it has been rendered illegible by being soaked in freezing
			sea-water - with the exception of a few words that you can just make out on one fragment of the 
			scroll. To your amazement, you see your own name written there, and also the phrase 'town of  rnex'.
			You go back to your rowing-boat, only to find that the <i>Blackheart</i> has disappeared into the
			thickening fog! You yell at the top of your voice, hoping they can hear you.
